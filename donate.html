<div id="content">
Right now, as it often has been in the past, there is an incredible amount of concentrated wealth and power which is actively directed towards keeping the population from basic human freedoms. 

This is being seen more and more via the political systems globally, with onerous regulation and spying becoming almost de-facto. Many are just starting to realize this fact. 

Everyone should have the right to a private conversation, and the right to transact their own personal money and property.  In a worldwide connected digital age, we believe the tool which can best protect these simple freedoms is correctly implemented strong cryptography.  This can only be achieved in full view of the public (knowledge, disclosure, and review).  In short: Free open-source code.

<br><br>

If you would like to donate to our general fund, here is our Bitcoin address:

<br><br>

WALLET ADDR HERE, w/QR Code.  BIP-47 PaymentAddress comes later.
<br><br>
<br>

In the near future, we are planning to accept dozens of other cryptocurrencies.  And as soon as possible, also accept donations via classical fiat currencies (GBP, EUR, USD, CNY, etc.) â€” although we must first navigate the time-sucking financial and legal labyrinth in order to do this effectively, enabling tax-free donations.  Please stay tuned.

<br><br>

We will also soon be allowing donations in which 100% of your donated funds can be earmarked for particular projects or cryptocurrencies.

So if you donate even one Satoshi or other coin micro-payment, it can be transparently watched on the blockchain as it becomes a line of written crypto code published to a public software respository such as GitHub.
