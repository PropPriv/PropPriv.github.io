Many are starting to realize the degree to which global spying and onerous regulations are denying us our basic human rights, which is unhealthy for a free and productive society.

Everyone has the right to a private conversation, and to transact their own personal money and property.  In a worldwide connected digital age, we believe the technology which can best protect these simple freedoms is correctly implemented strong cryptography.  This can only be achieved in full view of the public (knowledge, disclosure, and review) and free of outside pressures. In short: Free open-source code.

<br><br>

If you would like to donate to our general fund, here is our Bitcoin address:

<br><br>

WALLET ADDR HERE, w/QR Code.  BIP-47 PaymentAddress comes later.
<br><br>
<br>

In the near future, we are planning to accept dozens of other cryptocurrencies.  And as soon as possible, also accept donations via classical fiat currencies (GBP, EUR, USD, CNY, etc.) â€” although we must first navigate the time-sucking financial and legal labyrinth in order to do this effectively, enabling tax-free donations.  Please stay tuned.

<br><br>

We will also soon be allowing donations in which 100% of your donated funds can be earmarked for particular projects or cryptocurrencies.

So if you donate even one Satoshi or other coin micro-payment, it can be transparently watched on the blockchain as it becomes a line of written crypto code published to a public software respository such as GitHub.
