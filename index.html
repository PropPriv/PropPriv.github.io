	<h1><em>Announcing:</em><br>The Alliance for Property and Privacy Protection</h1>

	<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
Our cause is the protection and advancement of property and privacy rights for the underprivileged, and for broad public benefit, through code. PropPriv provides transparent funding for select, open-source, software/hardware projects that advance our cause.<br><br>We believe that code is much more effective at protecting rights and freedoms, when compared to alternate methods (lawsuits, lobbyists, <em>et cetera</em>). There are other groups who use those methods. We plan to use code. 
<h3>Impetus</h3>

The 

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden">Edward Snowden</a> revelations,
 secret court orders,
 and proposed controls such as SOPA and the
<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/leaked-burr-feinstein-encryption-bill-is-a-threat-to-american-privacy">Burr-Feinstein Anti-Encryption Bill</a>,

have made it clear that governments and corporations cannot be blindly trusted to protect our privacy and autonomy.

It is now undeniable that legal and extralegal means are being employed to violate our rights. This leaves the world open to backdoors, key theft, and the impersonation of trusted entities.
 Only free, publicly available, open-source software – unencumbered by shareholder obligations and political pressure – can stand against these attacks. The use of cryptography, combined with publicly transparent development and review, has the best chance of protecting our basic human rights, and the rights of every generation that follows.

	<!-- <h3>To be clear:</h3>
	We will not fund lobbying. We will not fund legal cases. We will only fund coding of open-source projects that have a direct, positive impact on freedom through cryptography.<br> -->

	<h2>Who are we?</h2>
	<div id="bios_links" class="tab">
	    <a href="bios.html#ladar">Ladar Levison</a><br>
	    <a href="bios.html#cliff">Cliff Baltzley</a><br>
		<a href="bios.html#chris">Chris Odom</a><br>
	</div>

	<br>
...and a growing list of donors and supporters who understand the value of strong cryptography for all people, everywhere. We fund the development of free technologies, not lawyers or lobbyists. We want to live in a world, using 21st century tools, in which everyone can speak freely, and can safely and securely manage their property and privacy.



	<!-- <h2>How can I contribute?</h2>
	If you want to help us help you, there are a few easy options.  The first is getting the word out.  Let your coder friends know that we're here to help.  If you know of some great open-source crypto projects, help us get in touch with them.  If you have a few crypto coins to spare, <a href="donate.html" style="color:#35AE36"><b>donate</b></a>.  Share the hashtag #PropPriv (twitter link at the bottom) wherever hashtags roam, or make a post in one of the crypto coding and freedom communities you frequent.  If nothing else, spare some good will, positivity is as supportive as negativity is caustic. -->
