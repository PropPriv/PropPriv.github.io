		<h1>Press Release: Announcing PropPriv</h1>
		<div><br>
			May 25, 2016 (Austin, Texas) The newly formed Property and Privacy Alliance (PropPriv.org) will work to advance freedom by supporting free, open-source, publicly-available software projects that advance and protect property and privacy rights through cryptography. The foundation will be headed by Lavabit founder Ladar Levison, Hushmail founder Cliff Baltzley, and Chris Odom, the creator of Open-Transactions and co-founder of StashCrypto.com.

        <br>
        The New York Times reports that the Obama administration is <em>&ldquo;is on the verge of permitting the National Security Agency to share more of the private communications it intercepts with other American intelligence agencies without first applying any privacy protections to them.&rdquo;</em><br><br>

        &ldquo;will be shared with other intelligence agencies like the FBI without first applying any screens for privacy.&rdquo;<br><br>

            <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
            <em>&ldquo;This basically formalizes what was already happening under the radar. We’ve known for a couple of years now that the Drug Enforcement Administration and the IRS were getting information from the NSA. Because that information was obtained without a warrant, the agencies were instructed to engage in &ldquo;parallel construction&rdquo; when explaining to courts and defense attorneys how the information had been obtained.&rdquo;</em>
            </div><br>
            And that&#39;s not the worst of it. It turns out the feds had these agreements with police agencies all over the country, &ldquo;affecting thousands of cases.&rdquo;

        From the ACLU of Massachusetts blog <b>Privacy SOS</b>:<br><br>
        <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
        <em>&ldquo;What does this rule change mean for you? In short, domestic law enforcement officials will soon have access to even larger troves of American communications, obtained without warrants, that they can use to put people in cages. If the rules governing FBI access to 12333 surveillance are like those that cover 702 collection, FBI agents won’t need to have any “national security” related reason to plug your name, email address, phone number, or other “selector” into the NSA’s gargantuan data trove. They could simply poke around in your private information in the course of totally routine investigations. And if they find something that suggests, say, involvement in illegal drug activity, they could send that information to local or state police. That means information the NSA collects for purposes of so-called “national security” will be used by police to lock up ordinary Americans for routine crimes.&rdquo;</em>

            (Reuters) Senior White House officials and U.S. intelligence and law enforcement figures will meet with Silicon Valley executives on Friday to discuss how to counter the use of social media by militant groups, sources familiar with the meeting said on Thursday.

        <div style="margin-left: 1em;">
            (Breitbart) The two largest social networks, Facebook and Twitter, and the world’s largest search engine, Google, have teamed up with German law enforcement to delete “hate speech” within 24 hours in what is being seen as a last-ditch effort to silence public dissent about a gigantic wave of Syrian immigration.

            TechCrunch quotes the Amicus brief: <em>&ldquo;...the FBI sought the private encryption key used by Lavabit to protect the Secure Socket Layer (“SSL”) and Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) connections to their servers. With the SSL/TLS private key in hand, the FBI would be able to impersonate Lavabit on the Internet. This would allow them to intercept, decrypt, inspect, and modify (either with intent, or by accident) all of the connections between Lavabit and the outside world...&rdquo;</em>
